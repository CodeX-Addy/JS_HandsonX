//Arrays in js is like lists in python in which we can store the values with different datatypes unlike c++ and java and they are mutable unlike strings

let arr = [1,2,3,4,"Eso"]
//console.log(arr)

//Arrays Methods in JS

let a = [1,2,3,4];
console.log(a.length); //length of the array
let b = a.toString(); //Converts arrays into strings
console.log(b);

console.log(a.join("-")); //Join elements and returns a string
